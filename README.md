MIT 1.001 Term Project_PubHub

Originally, we are interested in peopleâ€™s movement and transitions in cities.
In this way, Hubway, one of the favourite transit tool and a key element of the public transportation system comes into our mind. The usage of hubway generates a huge amount of data that we can look into, and use to understand the public transit system in these cities. 

During our observation, we find that the distribution of bike stations and dockings might cause these problems:
1. Sometimes it is hard to find an available bike in some stations in peak hour;
2. On the contrary, the bikes in some stations are not fully used.

In this way, our project studies the spatio-temporal patterns of hubway usage, and tries to find the most popular trips and potential bike shortage stations based on the data analysis and Google map API. Second, we make suggestions that how hubway stations might have optimized distribution among stations with different behaviors. Thirdly, we identify the relation between the shared hubway trips and other public transits such as bus routes, in order to see how it can complement the shortage of bikes in some specific stations at some moments. Finally, we build an interactive web application to show the results of our studies.

The technologies we have used are:
1. HTML and Javascript to make the website
2. Data analysis of the bike usage including origin and destination, time of use, seasonal variations of usage, etc. 
3. Google map API to return the Hubway routes and public transit routes
4. Visualization tools including Google Map, Google Charts, and Google Tables
5. Machine Learning to help classify the clusters

Our project deliverables are a video (https://youtu.be/CBef6ncwRWI) and the web app. By using the web app, users can understand the usage pattern of hubway bikes at each station on specific time, and the alternative travel options by using other public transit systems.
